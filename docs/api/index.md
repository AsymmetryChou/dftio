# API Reference

This section provides detailed, auto-generated documentation for the `dftio` Python API. Use this reference to understand the internal components, data structures, and parser implementations.

The API is organized into several key modules:

- **[I/O and Parsers (`dftio.io`)](./io.md):** The core parsing engine, including the abstract base parser and specific implementations for each supported DFT code.

- **[Data Structures (`dftio.data`)](./data.md):** The internal data containers used to store and manage atomic structures and calculation results.

For details on how to use these components, please refer to the pages linked above.
